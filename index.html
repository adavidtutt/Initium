    <div class="section-title">The Origin</div>
    <p>I don’t come from aerospace.
I come from punishment.
From hardships most can't imagine.
I come from fire.I was born in the shop. I learned how to build anything. To fix anything. To make anything better than it was before.

I was forged on the road. It's more home than home. NHRA, CARS, ARCA/CRA, UMP. Blacktop and dirt. Isolation. Failure in front of millions. Pain. And pleasure.

I know what it takes to earn respect of competitors. Men and women I grew up idolizing on television. Men and women who watched me work so fucking hard They called me Team No Sleep. Team Animal.

I was the one who stayed up all night at the track— While they slept.

The one who would not stop.

I know hardship by my own hand. I know failure of myself. I know loss on a scale I wish upon no one. I know the very edges of what humanity—and this life—have to offer. I know success. I know the fire. I have a habit of making my dreams come true. That’s why this is possible for me.

I know how to take a dream and manifest it— To make it an emergent property of materials and sheer fucking will. I know how to make a man survive anything. I can do anything.

This is the first solo-designed, solo-built, trans-planetary-class rocket engine. Conceived by me. Built with my own hands.

This is the first private design and build of a trans-planetary-class rocket— Born in the void between love and rage.

This is the first fully private mission of its kind. This is my legacy.

This engine is Belka. This rocket is Heretic. This company is Black Flag Discovery. The payload is Earth life.

And we are going to Mars.
